### BIO165 Systems Biology: Cell Physiology and Growth
Starting winter quarter 2022/23. A combination of classical lectures and dry-lab
classes to explore how major cellular processes need to be orchestrated and
fine-tuned with the encountered environment to form a functional unit. Python
based dry-lab sessions allow the analysis of recently collected data and further
provide an intro into modern modeling approaches. For undergradaute and graduate
students from biology and related disciplines.

### BIO120 Integrative and Experimental Microbiology
