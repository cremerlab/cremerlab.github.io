## Graduate students

If you are currently enrolled in Stanford and are interested in doing a rotation in our lab, please contact Jonas to schedule a (virtual) meeting. We love to hear about your scientific ideas and visions. We have experimental projects available in the fields of microbiology and microbiota research. Projects can cover more fundamental questions of bacterial physiology or have a more biomedical touch, depending on your interests. Experimentally, we are obsessed with the quantitative culturing of bacteria, integrating a range of culturing and analysis methods (bioreactors, microscopy, HPLC, etc). We also integrate modeling approaches to understand more integratively how the human gut microbiota is formed and how it interacts with the host.Not enrolled in Stanford yet? Please consider applying to the Biology graduate program, the Biophysics program, or any other graduate program of the Bio Sciences at Stanford. If you are unsure how this works, consider this guidance from our department. The department also hosts a PhD preview program. 

## Postdocs

Reach out to Jonas if you are interested in our work and want to discuss research ideas and perspectives. We are particularly interested in researchers. Currently we do not have open position to fill and can only support Postdocs who bring their own funding.

## Undergraduate students

We are participating in the Bio-X Summer Research Program and the B-SURP Program and encourage motivated students to apply. Feel free to contact Jonas via email, providing information about your background and your interests.

## Highschool students
We currently do not accept applications from high school students for positions in the lab.

## Lab community
To learn more about our lab and our commitment to building an integrative lab community, have a look at [this statement and lab guidelines] (https://cremerlab.github.io/guidelines) we put together.
