    Roshali de Silva is a postdoctoral research scholar at the Department of
    Biology. She is interested in studying the cell shape dynamics of microbes.
    Her PhD was focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms behind cell
    shape changes in haloarchaea. She is currently working on characterizing the
    cell size variations in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. She completed her Ph.D. in Molecular
    Microbiology at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia in December
    2019. She grew up in Sri Lanka.

  bio: > 
    Rebecca Christensen (“RC”, she/her, Hufflepuff) is a Research Assistant in
    the Cremer lab interested in the relationship between diverse microbial
    metabolic pathways in the human gut environment and human disease
    development. Her current research uses a bioinformatics approach to identify
    gut strains that produce hydrogen sulfide, a colorectal carcinogen, and
    strains that produce short-chain fatty acids, a major energy source for the
    gut epithelium. Outside of the world of science, she loves food (both eating
    and making), roller blading, cats, non-Adam Sandler movies, and anything
    outdoors!
