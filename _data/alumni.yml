  title: NSF Postdoctoral Fellow 
  dates: January 2021 - present
  bio: > 
    Griffin Chure (he/him) is a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral
    Research Fellow.  Broadly interested in the physics of adaptation, Griffin
    uses a combination of physical modeling, experimental dissection, and
    computational analysis to make quantitative predictions of eco-evolutionary 
    dynamics in static and fluctuating conditions. Beyond obsessing over the
    microbial world, he is interested in quantifying the myriad ways that humans
    impact the Earth and understanding how they alter the global biosphere. He
    studied Biology and Chemistry at the University of Utah (Bachelors) and
    attained a PhD in Molecular Biophysics from Caltech in 2020.

- name: August Burton
  title: Summer Undergraduate Researcher
  dates: July 2022 - present
  bio: > 
    August Burton is an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Biomedical
    Computation. He is interested in how the gut microbiome contributes to
    common gut diseases such as colon cancer, especially through the production
    of excess hydrogen sulfide. Currently, he uses a combination of
    bioinformatics and experiments to investigate the gut strains and bacterial
    proteases involved in hydrogen sulfide production in the large intestine.
    Outside of school and research, August is an avid participant in sports not
    quite cool enough to be in the Olympics.

- name: Roshali de Silva
  title: Postdoctoral Scholar
  dates: January 2020 - August 2023
  location: Arizona State University
  link: "https://search.asu.edu/profile/4928513"
  bio: > 
    Roshali de Silva is a postdoctoral research scholar at the Department of
    Biology. She is interested in studying the cell shape dynamics of microbes.
    Her PhD was focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms behind cell
    shape changes in haloarchaea. She is currently working on characterizing the
    cell size variations in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. She completed her Ph.D. in Molecular
    Microbiology at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia in December
    2019. She grew up in Sri Lanka.

- name: Rebecca Christensen (RC)
  title: Research Assistant 
  dates: January 2022 - February 2023
  bio: > 
    Rebecca Christensen (“RC”, she/her, Hufflepuff) is a Research Assistant in
    the Cremer lab interested in the relationship between diverse microbial
    metabolic pathways in the human gut environment and human disease
    development. Her current research uses a bioinformatics approach to identify
    gut strains that produce hydrogen sulfide, a colorectal carcinogen, and
    strains that produce short-chain fatty acids, a major energy source for the
    gut epithelium. Outside of the world of science, she loves food (both eating
    and making), roller blading, cats, non-Adam Sandler movies, and anything
    outdoors!
