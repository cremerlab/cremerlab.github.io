- title: Optimal Allocation and the Flux Parity Model 
  language: Python
  author: Griffin Chure
  year: 2022
  description: >
    This repository houses all of our work related to our recent paper presenting 
    the flux-parity model of ribosomal allocation. Custom software (`growth.py`)
    provides utilities for numerical integration of different allocation models 
    with various features.

- title: Collective movement by chemotaxis
  author: Jonas Cremer
  language: Python
  year: 2019 
  description: >
    This Python code can be used to numerically solve the Growth Expansion
    Model we recently formulated to describe the collective growth of
    chemotactic bacterial populations moving (and competing) along self-driven
    gradients.

- title: Analyzing bacterial swimming behavior
  author: Jonas Cremer
  language: Python
  year: 2019 
  description: >
    We used this Python based script to track swimming bacterial cells and to
    get a statistics of their swimming behavior, including the fraction of
    non-motile cells.

  description: >
    We used this Python script to analyze expansion and growth dynamics of
    fluorescently labeled cells expanding in soft-agar.

- title: Modeling growth of the human gut microbiota
  author: Jonas Cremer
  language: Python
  year: 2019 
  description: >
    Towards a mechanistic understanding of the human gut microbiota and its
    composition,  we developed a spatiotemporal model of bacterial growth within
    the human large intestine, considering key factors like nutrient
    availability, flow conditions and pH. Send an email to Jonas if you are
    interested in the code.
