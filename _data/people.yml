- name: Jonas Cremer
  title: Principal Investigator
  dates: January 2020 - present
  bio: >
    Jonas Cremer is an Assistant Professor in Biology. He is interested in the
    physiology and growth of prokaryotes. Jonas studied physics and biophysics
    in Munich. He was a postdoctoral research at the University of California,
    San Diego. Before joining Stanford, he was an Assistant Professor at the
    University of Groningen. His current research considers various scales of
    prokaryotic life (from the coordination of fundamental processes within
    cells to the collective behavior of cells in specific ecological settings),
    with a focus on gut bacteria and the model organism <i>Escherichia coli</i>.

- name: Richa Sharma
  title: Postdoctoral Scholar 
  dates: January 2021 - present
  bio: > 
    Richa Sharma is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the lab since January,
    2021. She is mainly interested in understanding the eco-physiology of human
    gut strains including <i>Escherichia coli</i> and beyond. She is also keen
    to understand the functional aspects of these resident strains and their
    impact on human health. She studied Biotechnology in her Bachelors and
    Energy Studies in Masters. She attained her doctoral degree in Soil
    Microbial Ecology from Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi (IIT Delhi) in
    November, 2019.

- name: Leron Perez
  title: PhD Candidate in Biophysics
  dates: July 2021 - present
  bio: > 
    Leron Perez (he/him) is a PhD student Biophysics, and is jointly advised by
    Jonas Cremer and Drew Endy. Leron is interested in understanding microbial
    adaptation to uncertain and changing environments to improve synthetic
    biological design. His current research explores how <i>Escherichia coli</i>
    in the human gut survive in environments that change faster than protein
    synthesis can keep up. Outside of the lab, Leron enjoys spending time in
    nature, playing soccer, and reading. Leron received his B.S. in Molecular
    Engineering at the University of Chicago in 2020.

- name: Shaili Mathur
  title: PhD Student in Biology
  dates: June 2022- present
  bio: > 
    Shaili Mathur (she/her) is a PhD student in Biology in the Ecology and
    Evolution Track, and is jointly advised by Jonas Cremer and Dmitri Petrov.
    She is interested in combining mathematical, computational and experimental
    techniques to study complex biological systems in dynamic environments. When
    she isn't coding or pipetting, Shaili can be found playing ultimate frisbee,
    cooking, or oil painting. Shaili received her B.S. in Computational and
    Systems Biology with a minor in Mathematics and M.S. in Bioinformatics from
    UCLA in 2021.

- name: Mathis Leblanc
  title: PhD Student in Biophysics
  dates: July 2022 - present
  bio: > 
    Mathis Leblanc is a graduate student in Biophysics. Trained in protein
    thermodynamics, Mathis is now interested in the intersection of molecular
    biophysics and bacterial physiology. He is currently using numerical
    simulations to investigate the mechanisms of cell-shape regulation in
    <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Outside of the lab, he can be found playing piano, tea
    tasting, or reading to reach his annual goodreads goal. Mathis received his
    B.A. in Biophysics at Johns Hopkins in 2021.
