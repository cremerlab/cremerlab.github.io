- name: Jonas Cremer
  title: Principal Investigator
  dates: January 2020 - present
  bio: >
    Jonas Cremer is an Assistant Professor in Biology. He is interested in the
    physiology and growth of prokaryotes. Jonas studied physics and biophysics
    in Munich. He was a postdoctoral research at the University of California,
    San Diego. Before joining Stanford, he was an Assistant Professor at the
    University of Groningen. His current research considers various scales of
    prokaryotic life (from the coordination of fundamental processes within
    cells to the collective behavior of cells in specific ecological settings),
    with a focus on gut bacteria and the model organism <i>Escherichia coli</i>.

- name: Richa Sharma
  title: Postdoctoral Scholar 
  dates: January 2021 - present
  bio: > 
    Richa Sharma is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow joined in from January, 2021. She
    is mainly interested in understanding the eco-physiology of human gut strains
    including <i>E. coli</i> and beyond. She is also keen to understand the functional
    aspects of these resident strains and their impact on human health. She studied
    Biotechnology in her Bachelors and Energy Studies in Masters. She attained her
    doctoral degree in Soil Microbial Ecology from Indian Institute of
    Technology-Delhi (IIT Delhi) in November, 2019.

- name: Griffin Chure
  title: NSF Postdoctoral Fellow 
  dates: January 2021 - present
  bio: > 
    Griffin Chure (he/him) is a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral
    Research Fellow.  Broadly interested in the physics of adaptation, Griffin
    uses a combination of physical modeling, experimental dissection, and
    computational analysis to make quantitative predictions of eco-evolutionary 
    dynamics in static and fluctuating conditions. Beyond obsessing over the
    microbial world, he is interested in quantifying the myriad ways that humans
    impact the Earth and understanding how they alter the global biosphere. He
    studied Biology and Chemistry at the University of Utah (Bachelors) and
    attained a PhD in Molecular Biophysics from Caltech in 2020.

- name: Mathis Leblanc
  title: PhD Student in Biophysics
  dates: July 2022 - present
  bio: > 
    Mathis Leblanc is a graduate student in Biophysics. Trained in protein
    thermodynamics, Mathis is now interested in the intersection of molecular
    biophysics and bacterial physiology. He is currently using numerical
    simulations to investigate the mechanisms of cell-shape regulation in
    Escherichia coli. Outside of the lab, he can be found playing piano, tea
    tasting, or reading to reach his annual goodreads goal. Mathis received his
    B.A. in Biophysics at Johns Hopkins in 2021.

- name: Rebecca Christensen (RC)
  title: Research Assistant 
  dates: April 2022 - present
  bio: > 
    Rebecca Christensen (“RC”, she/her, Hufflepuff) is a Research Assistant in
    the Cremer lab interested in the relationship between diverse microbial
    metabolic pathways in the human gut environment and human disease
    development. Her current research uses a bioinformatics approach to identify
    gut strains that produce hydrogen sulfide, a colorectal carcinogen, and
    strains that produce short-chain fatty acids, a major energy source for the
    gut epithelium. Outside of the world of science, she loves food (both eating
    and making), roller blading, cats, non-Adam Sandler movies, and anything
    outdoors!

- name: August Burton
  title: Summer Undergraduate Researcher
  dates: July 2022 - present
  bio: > 
    August Burton is an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Biomedical
    Computation. He is interested in how the gut microbiome contributes to
    common gut diseases such as colon cancer, especially through the production
    of excess hydrogen sulfide. Currently, he uses a combination of
    bioinformatics and experiments to investigate the gut strains and bacterial
    proteases involved in hydrogen sulfide production in the large intestine.
    Outside of school and research, August is an avid participant in sports not
    quite cool enough to be in the Olympics.
